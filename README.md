# Force Jetpack SSO

This plugin automatically enables [Jetpack's "WordPress.com Secure Sign On" module](https://jetpack.com/support/sso/) in production sites.

SSO will automatically be disabled on non-production sites (when the [wp_get_environment_type()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_environment_type/) function returns anything different than `production`).

## Usage

1. Download the .zip file from https://github.com/a8cteam51/team51-force-jetpack-sso/releases
2. Via the wp-admin plugins page on your WordPress site, upload the zip file and activate the plugin

### Updates

This plugin will get automatically updated when a new version is released in https://github.com/a8cteam51/team51-force-jetpack-sso/releases.
